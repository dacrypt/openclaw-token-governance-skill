# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to the maintainer through GitHub Security Advisories
or direct private contact.

- Affected version/commit

## Scope

This project processes local OpenClaw session logs and usage metadata. Review
